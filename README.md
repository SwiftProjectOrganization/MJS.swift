# MJS.swift

## Purpose

MJS.swift is an IOS application to the scores of one or more MahJong tournaments.

A MahJong tournament consists of all four players being the wind players for all 4 winds. Thus in total at least 26 games, but usually more. 

Completion of a tournament can take days, weeks or even much longer. That's why I developed this little app.

## Usage

Create a tournament by tapping the "+". Select the newly created tournament. All players should have 2000 points. Press "Game completed" and, if necessary, rotate the players and enter the computed scores.
