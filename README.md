# MJS.swift

## Purpose

MJS.swift is an IOS application to the scores of one or more MahJong tournaments.

A MahJong tournament consists of all four players being the wind players for all 4 winds. Thus in total at least 26 games, but usually more. 

Completion of a tournament can take days, weeks or even much longer. That's why I developed this little app.

## Usage

Create a tournament by tapping the "+". Select the newly created tournament. All players should have 2000 points. Press "Game completed" and, if necessary, rotate the players and enter the computed scores.

## Notes

The "computed" scores are the game result for each player.

## To do

1. Icloud storage of tournamets.

2. Horizontal alignment in CompletedGameView needs to be improved.

3. Use of @AppStorage

4. Currently the IndividualTournamentView shows game status according to the current wind. It might be better to hold player positions fixed.

5. Is it useful to keep overall players scores?
